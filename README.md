## Disclaimer
These configs are pretty messy and not complete use at your own risk. There is also some system specific stuff in the polybar config for my desktop's monitor situation.

## Usage
Create symbolic links to the appropriate locations for the configs with:

'''ln /path/to/polybar-config ~/.config/polybar/config'''

'''ln /path/to/polybar-config ~/.config/polybar/config'''
